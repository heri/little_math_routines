Little Math Routines in Rust, for your Ruby app

`little_math_routines` ensures performance improvements by offloading computation to Rust. Itâ€™s perfect for applications requiring fast, reliable calculations with large datasets. The methods are efficient for statistical operations, linear regression, geospatial distance computations, and more.

# Distance Calculations
* Haversine Distance - Distance between points on the Earth's surface.

```Ruby
require 'LittleMath'

math = LittleMath.new
coord1 = [40.7128, -74.0060] # New York City
coord2 = [34.0522, -118.2437] # Los Angeles

distance = math.haversine_distance(coord1, coord2)
puts "The distance between NYC and LA is #{distance.round(2)} km"
```

# Statistics
mean, variance
```Ruby
data = [10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0]

mean = math.mean(data)
variance = math.variance(data, mean)

puts "Mean: #{mean}"
puts "Variance: #{variance}"
```

min, max, median, mode
```Ruby
data = [5.0, 2.0, 9.0, 2.0, 7.0]

min = math.min(data)
max = math.max(data)
median = math.median(data)
mode = math.mode(data)

puts "Min: #{min}, Max: #{max}, Median: #{median}, Mode: #{mode}"
```

Linear regression example
```Ruby
x_values = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
y_values = [10.0, 20.0, 30.0, 40.0]

model = math.linear_reg(x_values, y_values)

# Extract coefficients
intercept = model[0]
coefficient = model[1]

puts "Linear Regression Model: y = #{coefficient}x + #{intercept}"

# Predict values
predicted_y = coefficient * 5.0 + intercept
puts "Predicted value for x = 5.0: #{predicted_y}"
```
